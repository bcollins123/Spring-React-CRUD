React.js and Spring Data REST - CRUD
====================================

CRUD application with security enabled: a PoC with
ReactJS in the frontend and Spring Data REST in the backend.

Based in the "security" module code here: https://github.com/spring-guides/tut-react-and-spring-data-rest

Guide: https://spring.io/guides/tutorials/react-and-spring-data-rest


Usage
-----

Launch the application with:

    $ mvn spring-boot:run

Or use `./mvnw` instead of `mvn` (`mvnw.cmd` for Window platforms).

Then access the application with http://localhost:8080/, or access
to the API with http://localhost:8080/api/

To edit Javascript or CSS resources and see the changes in the
browser without the need to re-launch the appliation, execute within
a command line:

    $ target/node/npm run watch

And leave it running.
